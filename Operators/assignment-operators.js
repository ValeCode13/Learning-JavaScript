//  Basic Assignment Operator - 'assigning' 10 to the variable x.
let x = 10;

x++; // with this we increment the value of x by 1.
x = x + 1;

// Addition Operator:
x = x + 5;
x += 5;

//Multiplication Operator: 
x = x * 3;
x *= 3;

// Combination of Assignment Operator:
x += 13;
x -= 13:
x *= 13;
x /= 13;
